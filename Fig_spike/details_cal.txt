because of a typo "4p" refers to the model with four active channels, ie the five-current model, for convenience "2p" is used to mean the three-current model

new calculation

4p peak start time is

for the 2p the plot starts at 40 when the spike starts at 0.04205 

so there is 0.00205 between the start of the plot and the spike start

0.0931-0.00205 = 0.09105 so that's the start and we should take that away from times and multiply by 1000 -> we do that to 4p_details to get the important times




old calculation
___________

4p_details has the details for the 4p model


4p peak 0.126425
2p peak 0.042625

delta peak 0.126245-0.042625 = 0.0836

2p range 40 - 60
so 4p range 123.6-133.6
